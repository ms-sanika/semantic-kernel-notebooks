## Getting Started

You'll need to have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed on your computer with .NET 7. Then, you'll need to install a special extension that lets you run Jupyter notebooks within VS Code. Lastly, you can explore AI driven agenda crafting  by stepping through the [Agenda Crafting notebook](./AgendaCrafting/notebook.ipynb) after you've installed your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key.

### Step 1: Set up your environment for running the .C# notebooks

1. [Install .NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
2. [Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. Launch VS Code and [install the "Polyglot" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode).


### Step 2: Install your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key

Go to the [`1-start-here` notebook](getting-started/00-gettingstarted.ipynb) to set your credentials so that Semantic Kernel knows how to access your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key.

### Step 3: Now go ahead and run any of the C# notebooks
